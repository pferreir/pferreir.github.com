The [Bravia Chaimite](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bravia_Chaimite) was one of the few Portuguese-made armoured vehicles to ever be produced. It was instrumental in the [Colonial War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_Colonial_War) and became a symbol of the 1974 [Carnation Revolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnation_Revolution).

I've been modelling one using Blender. Having very little background in 3D design, it cost me a little to follow the learning curve. I eventually managed to produce the model in the images. I am pretty happy about it. You can see it in action in a [jMonkeyEngine](http://jmonkeyengine.com/) scene just below.

I still have to model the turret. More news soon, I hope.
